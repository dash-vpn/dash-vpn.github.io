# Support

Welcome to Dash VPN support. Find answers to common questions below.

## Getting Started

### How do I add an Outline server?

1. Get an Outline access key from your server administrator (starts with `ss://`)
2. Open Dash VPN
3. Click "Add Server" or the + button
4. Paste your access key
5. Click "Connect"

### Where do I get an Outline server?

Dash VPN is a client app - you need your own Outline server. Options:

- **Self-host:** Set up your own server using [Outline Manager](https://getoutline.org/)
- **From others:** Get an access key from someone who runs an Outline server

## Routing Modes

Dash VPN offers three routing modes:

### Rule Mode 🎯

Smart routing based on predefined rules:
- Domestic/local traffic goes direct (faster)
- International traffic goes through VPN
- Best for daily use in regions with internet restrictions

### Direct Mode ⚡

- All traffic bypasses the VPN
- VPN connection stays ready but inactive
- Useful when you need full direct access temporarily

### Global Mode 🌐

- All traffic routes through VPN
- Maximum privacy and security
- Use when you need everything protected

## FAQ

### Why can't I connect to my server?

Common causes:
- Invalid or expired access key
- Server is offline or unreachable
- Network blocking Outline protocol

Try:
1. Verify your access key is correct
2. Check if the server is running
3. Try connecting from a different network

### Does Dash VPN work with other VPN protocols?

No. Dash VPN only works with Outline servers using the Shadowsocks protocol.

### Is Dash VPN the same as Outline?

No. Dash VPN is an independent client app. It's not affiliated with Jigsaw or the official Outline apps. Dash VPN adds features like smart routing modes that aren't in the official Outline client.

### Does Dash VPN log my traffic?

No. Dash VPN does not collect, log, or transmit any of your traffic or personal data. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) for details.
