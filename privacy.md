# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 2025**

Dash VPN is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data We Don't Collect

Dash VPN does **not** collect, store, or transmit:

- Your VPN traffic or browsing history
- Your IP address or location
- Personal information or identifiers
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Server credentials you enter

## How the App Works

Dash VPN is a client application that connects to Outline servers you configure. All server credentials are stored locally on your device using the system keychain.

- **Server credentials** are stored securely in your device's keychain
- **Routing rules** are stored locally on your device
- **No data** is sent to our servers because we don't operate any servers

## Third-Party Services

The only network connections made by Dash VPN are:

1. To the Outline servers you configure
2. To Apple's App Store for license verification

We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Your Control

You have complete control over your data:

- Delete server configurations at any time
- Uninstall the app to remove all local data
- No account required to use the app

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dash-vpn/dash-vpn.github.io/issues).
