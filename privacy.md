# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 2025**

Dash VPN is a privacy-focused application. We do not collect, store, or sell your data.

## 1. Zero-Logs Policy

We fundamentally respect your privacy. Dash VPN does **NOT** collect or store:

- **Your Network Traffic:** We do not log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries.
- **Your IP Address:** We do not collect or store your original IP address.
- **Connection Data:** We do not log session durations or connection timestamps.

## 2. Data stored on your device

Dash VPN functions entirely as a client on your device.

- **Server Credentials:** Your server configurations are stored securely in your device's Keychain. We have no access to them.
- **Routing Rules:** Stored locally within the app.

## 3. Diagnostic Data (Anonymous)

To improve app stability, we collect **anonymous** crash reports (via Sentry) only when the app malfunctions.

- **What is sent:** Device model (e.g., iPhone 15), iOS version, and the technical error that caused the crash.
- **What is NOT sent:** No personal information, no traffic data, and **no IP addresses**.
- **Opt-Out:** You can disable this in the application settings at any time.

## 4. User Support

If you contact us for support (e.g., via email), we will only use the information you voluntarily provide to assist you. We do not share this information with third parties.
